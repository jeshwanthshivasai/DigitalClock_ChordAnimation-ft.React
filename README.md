# Digital Clock with Strung Chord Animation

This project is a **Digital Clock** built using React. It displays the current time and includes a unique "strung chord" animation effect that plays every time a second passes. The design mimics a vintage-modern digital clock, with dynamic background changes based on the time of day.

## Features

- **Current Time Display**: The clock shows the current time based on the user's location or a random timezone if access is denied.
- **Background Animation**: The background changes dynamically based on the time of day, using nature-themed transitions (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night).
- **Strung Chord Animation**: A strung chord animation effect occurs every second, giving the illusion of time being pulled forward with sound effects and visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (Class-based components)
- **CSS** for styling and animations
- **JavaScript** for time handling and timezone logic
